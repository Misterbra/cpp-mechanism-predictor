2.X Comparison with Existing Tools

Several computational tools have been developed for CPP prediction (Table X).
MLCPP 2.0 [ref] and CPPred-RF [ref] predict both CPP classification (CPP vs
non-CPP) and uptake efficiency (high vs low). SkipCPP-Pred [ref], CellPPD [ref],
and other tools focus solely on binary CPP classification.

Critically, NONE of these existing tools predict the uptake MECHANISM
(endocytosis vs direct translocation). This represents a significant gap in
the CPP prediction landscape, as the uptake mechanism has profound implications
for drug delivery applications:

- Endocytosis often leads to cargo entrapment in endosomes
- Direct translocation provides immediate cytoplasmic access

CPPMechPred addresses this gap by providing the first machine learning model
specifically designed to predict uptake mechanism from sequence. Unlike existing
tools that answer "Is this peptide a CPP?", CPPMechPred answers "HOW does this
CPP enter cells?"

It is important to note that CPPMechPred is complementary to, not competitive
with, existing tools. Users would first use tools like MLCPP 2.0 to identify
potential CPPs, then use CPPMechPred to predict their uptake mechanism.
